# Work-Day-Calendar

This project was about utilizing local storage as well as moment to create a day planner that would let the user know what day of the year it was as well as use colors to show them what part of the day they were on. I learned about moment as well as bootstrap to really make a lot of this project much easier as well as continuing to get more comfortable with event listeners.

I am over all very happy with a lot of this code however it is very wet. I had trouble figuring out how to dynamically create variables in loops which meant that things were very repetative. Once I figure that out I know it can be streamlined a lot tho.
